# Recall

Durable, cross-machine archive of every Claude Code session, with a small
HTTP API for searching your history and recalling where you left off.

## What it does

Claude Code stores its transcripts as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/`
on the machine where each session ran. That's locked to one machine, and
Claude Code will eventually rotate those files out. Recall sweeps them
into Postgres on a central host (over Tailscale or LAN) so every machine
you use writes to the same archive, and the archive survives local
cleanup.

## Pieces

- **`postgres/`** — Dockerized Postgres database + HTTP API (Bun + Hono).
  Lives on one central host; every other machine talks to it.
- **`shared/`** — Parser, types, and redaction used by the sync and API.
- **`file-based/`** — Zero-setup JSONL search, no database required.
  Useful for quick one-off searches on a single machine.

## Quick start — Postgres

```bash
cd postgres
bun install
bun run db:up                        # starts the Docker stack
DATABASE_URL="postgres://claude:sessions@localhost:5433/claude_sessions" \
    bun run sync                     # populate
DATABASE_URL="…" bun run serve       # HTTP API on :3847
```

Then schedule `bun run sync.ts` every 15 minutes on each machine you use
Claude Code from (launchd on macOS, systemd user timer on Linux). New
sessions show up in the archive within the interval.

## Quick start — file-based

```bash
bun run file-based/search.ts --query "email system" --days 7
```

No database, no setup — just greps your local JSONLs. Useful until you
have enough history to want real search.

## API (Postgres mode)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `GET` | `/sessions` | Search/list — `?search=`, `?days=`, `?since=`, `?until=`, `?tools=`, `?file_pattern=`, `?hostname=`, `?limit=` |
| `GET` | `/sessions/:id` | Single session. `?with_transcript=true` returns the full archived transcript. |
| `GET` | `/sessions/stats` | Usage stats. `?days=N` to scope. |

See `postgres/api.ts` for the source of truth.

## Using from Claude Code

The natural pairing is a `/recall` skill that hits the HTTP API when the
user asks things like *"where did we leave off on X"* or *"what did we
discuss about Y last week"*. There's a starter skill in
`shared/claude-skill.md`.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_SESSIONS_DIR` | `~/.claude/projects` | Where Claude Code writes its JSONLs |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://localhost/claude_sessions` | Postgres connection string |
| `RECALL_HOSTNAME` | `os.hostname()` | Overrides the hostname stamped on rows — useful for one-time imports from a retired machine |
| `PORT` | `3847` | HTTP API port |

archival in JSONB, profanity redaction at sync time, daily pg_dump
backups, and Postgres 18.
